<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Analyze employee churn. Find out why employees are leaving the company, and learn to predict who will leave the company</strong></p>
<p>Employee turnover refers to the gradual loss of employees over a period of time. Acquiring new employees as a replacement has its costs such as hiring costs and training costs. Also, the new employee will take time to learn skills at the similar level of technical or business expertise knowledge of an older employee. Organizations tackle this problem by <strong>applying machine learning techniques to predict employee churn</strong>, which helps them in taking necessary actions.</p>
<p><strong>Employee turnover (attrition) is a major cost to an organization, and predicting turnover is at the forefront of needs of Human Resources (HR) in many organizations.</strong></p>
<p>In Research, it was found that employee churn will be affected by age, tenure, pay, job satisfaction, salary, working conditions, growth potential and employee’s perceptions of fairness. Some other variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, and marital status, were essential factors in the prediction of employee churn.</p>
<p><strong>Attrition can happen for many reasons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees looking for better opportunities.</li>
<li>A negative working environment.</li>
<li>Bad management</li>
<li>Sickness of an employee (or even death)</li>
<li>Excessive working hours</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increasing customer retention rates could increase profits</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Structure of the Project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong>: One of the first things in my journey of Data Science, was to always know the story behind the data. What’s the point of implementing predictive algorithms if you don’t know what your data is about? My philosophy is to “drill down” the data until I find interesting insights that will give me a better understanding of my data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendations</strong>: What recommendations will I give the organization based on the analysis made with this data. How can the organization <code>reduce the rate of attrition</code> inside the company? In my opinion, this is the most important part of the analysis because it gives us a better understanding of what the organization could do to avoid the negative effect of attrition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modeling</strong>: Implement a predictive model to determine whether an employee is going to quit or not.</p></li>

<h4>Structure</h4>
<p><strong>How many columns and observations is there in our dataset?</strong></p>
<p>The raw data contains <code>1,250</code> rows (customers) and <code>35</code> columns (features). The <strong>“Attrition”</strong> is the label in our dataset and we would like to find out why employees are leaving the organization!</p>
<p><strong>We only have two datatypes in this dataset: <code>factors</code> and <code>integers</code></strong></p>
<p>Most features in this dataset are <code>ordinal</code> variables which are similar to categorical variables however, ordering of those variables matter. A lot of the variables in this dataset have a range from 1-4 or 1-5, The lower the ordinal variable, the worse it is in this case. For instance, Job Satisfaction 1 = “Low” while 4 = “Very High”.</p>
<p>After you have loaded the dataset, you might want to know a little bit more about it. You can check attributes names and datatypes.</p>
<p>Change all character data types to factors. This is needed for H2O. We could make a number of other numeric data that is actually categorical factors, but this tends to increase modeling time and can have little improvement on model performance.</p>

<h4><strong>Compensation features</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Income</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact of Income towards Attrition</strong> I wonder how much importance does each employee give to the income they earn in the organization. Here we will find out if it is true that money is really everything!</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the average monthly income by department? Are there any significant differences between individuals who quit and didn’t quit?</li>
<li>Are there significant changes in the level of income by Job Satisfaction? Are individuals with a lower satisfaction getting much less income than the ones who are more satisfied?</li>
<li>Do employees who quit the organization have a much lower income than people who didn’t quit the organization?</li>
<li>Do employees with a higher performance rating earn more than with a lower performance rating? Is the difference significant by Attrition status?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Income by Departments</strong>: We can see huge differences in each department by attrition status.</li>
<li><strong>Income by Job Satisfaction</strong>: It seems the lower the job satisfaction the wider the gap by attrition status in the levels of income.</li>
<li><strong>Attrition sample population</strong>: I would say that most of this sample population has had a salary increase of less than 15% and a monthly income of less than 7,000</li>
<li><strong>Exhaustion at Work</strong>: Over 54% of workers who left the organization worked overtime! Will this be a reason why employees are leaving?</li>
<li><strong>Differences in the DailyRate</strong>: <code>HealthCare Representatives</code> , <code>Sales Representatives</code>, and <code>Research Scientists</code> have the biggest daily rates differences in terms of employees who quit or didn’t quit the organization. This might indicate that at least for the these roles, the sample population that left the organization was mainly because of <code>income</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems fair to say that a large majority of those who left had a relatively <code>lower monthly income</code> and daily rate while the never made it in majority into the higher hourly rate group. On the other hand, the differences become elusive when comparing the monthly rate.</p>

<p>This shows years at company in relation to years since last promotion, grouped by both <code>attrition</code> and <code>overtime</code>. This is an interesting issue, since a high correlation between these two variables (longer you are in the company, less chance you have to be promoted, so to speak) may mean that people are not really growing within the company. However, since this is a simulated dataset we cannot compare it with some norms outside it, so we can compare certain groups within our set, e.g. those who are working overtime and those who are not.</p>

<p><strong>Generation</strong></p>
<p>What is the average number of companies previously worked for each generation? My aim is to see if it is true that past generations used to stay longer in one company.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Employees who quit the organization</strong>: For these type of employees we see that the boomers had a higher number of companies previously worked at.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Millenials</strong>: Most millenials are still relatively young, so that explains why the number of companies for millennials is relatively low however, I expect this number to increase as the years pass by.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attrition by Generation</strong>: It seems that millennial are the ones with the highest turnover rate, followed by the boomers. What does this tell us? The newer generation which are the millennial opt to look more easy for other jobs that satisfy the needs on the other side we have the boomers which are approximating retirement and could be one of the reasons why the turnover rate of boomers is the second highest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understanding Generational Behavior:</strong> Distribution of number of companies worked by <code>attrition</code> and <code>age</code>.

<h4><strong>Using Automated Machine Learning with H2o</strong></h4>
<p>H2o is a library that helps us implement the best machine learning models in order to come up with the most accurate predictions. What is really interesting about this library is that it does all the backend work for us that we normally do when implementing ML models. Maybe that’s why it is an automated machinelearning library? What things does H2o does for us here are some of the things that I have seen while using H2o.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-Validation</strong>: There is no need to worry about cross validation the automl function takes care of that.</li>
<li><strong>Parameter Optimization</strong>: H2o takes care of finding the most appropiate parameters in order to come up with the most accurate solution.</li>
<li><strong>Testing Different Models</strong>: H2o uses different models to come up with the most accurate solution.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>recipe_obj &lt;- recipe(Attrition ~ ., data = train_readable_tbl) %&gt;%

</div>
<div id="key-concepts" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Key Concepts</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training Frame</strong> : Used to develop model.</li>
<li><strong>Validation Frame</strong> : Used to tune hyperparameters via grid search.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboard Frame</strong>: Test set completely held out from model training &amp; tuning.</li>
<li>Use <code>max_run_time_secs</code> to minimize modeling time initially. Once results look promising.</li>
<li>increase the run time to get more models with highly tuned parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, we need to initialize the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that H2O uses locally.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>h2o.init()</code></pre>
<p>Next, we change our data to an h2o object that the package can interpret. We also split the data into training, validation, and test sets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>split_h2o &lt;- train_tbl %&gt;%
  # Putting the original dataframe into an h2o format.
  as.h2o() %&gt;%
  # Splitting into training, validation and testing sets.
  h2o.splitFrame(ratios = c(0.85), seed = 1234)

# Obtaining our three types of sets into three separate values.
train_h2o &lt;- split_h2o[[1]]
valid_h2o &lt;- split_h2o[[2]]
test_h2o  &lt;- test_tbl %&gt;% as.h2o()</code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to model. We’ll set the target and feature names. The target is what we aim to predict (in our case “Attrition”). The features (every other column) are what we will use to model the prediction.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set names for h2o
y &lt;- &quot;Attrition&quot;
x &lt;- setdiff(names(train_h2o), y)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>x = x</strong>: The names of our feature columns.</li>
<li><strong>y = y</strong>: The name of our target column.</li>
<li><strong>training_frame = train_h2o</strong>: Training set consisting of 85% of the data.</li>
<li><strong>leaderboard_frame = valid_h2o</strong>: Validation set. H2O uses this to ensure the model does not overfit the data.</li>
<li><strong>max_runtime_secs = 50</strong>: This is to speed up H2O’s modeling. The algorithm has a large number of complex models so we want to keep things moving at the expense of some accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># Run the automated machine learning 
automl_models_h20 &lt;- h2o.automl(
    x = x,
    y = y,

<h3><strong>What’s important to HR.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Precision</strong> is when the model predicts yes, how often is it actually <code>yes</code>. <strong>Recall</strong> (also true positive rate or specificity) is when the actual value is <code>yes</code> <strong>how often is the model correct</strong>.</p>
<p>Most HR groups would probably prefer to incorrectly classify folks not looking to quit as high potential of quiting rather than classify those that are likely to quit as not at risk. Because it’s important to not miss at risk employees, <strong>HR will really care about recall</strong> or <strong>when the actual value is Attrition = YES how often the model predicts YES</strong>.</p>
<p>Recall for our model is <strong>67%</strong>. In an HR context, this is <strong>67% more employees that could potentially be targeted prior to quiting</strong>. From that standpoint, an organization that loses 100 people per year could possibly target 67 implementing measures to retain.</p>

<h2><strong>What causes attrition</strong></h2>
<div id="local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations-lime-for-black-box-model-explanation." class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)</strong> for Black-Box Model Explanation.</h3>
<p>The machine learning model predicts the probability of someone leaving the company. This probability is then converted to a prediction of either leave or stay through a process called <strong>Binary Classification</strong>. However, this doesn’t solve the main objective, which is to make better decisions. It only tells us which employees are highest risk and therefore high probability. We can hone in on these individuals, but we need a different tool to understand why an individual is leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Explanations are MORE CRITICAL to the business than PERFORMANCE</strong>. Think about it. What good is a high performance model that predicts employee attrition if we can’t tell <strong>what features are causing people to quit?</strong> We need explanations to improve business decision making. Not just performance.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is identify the class of our model leader object. We do this with the class() function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(glm_model)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;H2OBinomialModel&quot;
## attr(,&quot;package&quot;)
## [1] &quot;h2o&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next we create our <code>model_type</code> function. It’s only input is x the h2o model. The function simply returns “classification”, which tells LIME we are classifying.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setup lime::model_type() function for h2o
model_type.H2OBinomialModel &lt;- function(x, ...) {
    # Function tells lime() what model type we are dealing with
    # &#39;classification&#39;, &#39;regression&#39;, &#39;survival&#39;, &#39;clustering&#39;, &#39;multilabel&#39;, etc
    #
    # x is our h2o model
    
    return(&quot;classification&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can create our <code>predict_model</code> function. Inputs must be <code>x</code> a model, <code>newdata</code> a dataframe object and <code>type</code> which is not used but can be use to switch the output type. The output is a little tricky because it must be in the format of probabilities by classification.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setup lime::predict_model() function for h2o
predict_model.H2OBinomialModel &lt;- function(x, newdata, type, ...) {
    # Function performs prediction and returns dataframe with Response
    #
    # x is h2o model
    # newdata is data frame
    # type is only setup for data frame
    
    pred &lt;- h2o.predict(x, as.h2o(newdata))
    
    # return probs
    return(as.data.frame(pred[,-1]))
    
}</code></pre>
<p>This will show you what the output looks like and to test our <code>predict_model</code> function. See how it’s the probabilities by classification. It must be in this form for model_type = “classification”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Test our predict_model() function
predict_model(x = glm_model, newdata = as.data.frame(test_h2o[,-1]), type = &#39;raw&#39;) %&gt;%
    tibble::as_tibble()</code></pre>

<p>Now the fun part, we create an <strong>explainer</strong> using the <code>lime()</code> function. Just pass the training data set without the “Attribution column”. The form must be a data frame, which is OK since our <code>predict_model</code> function will switch it to an h2o object. Set model = models our leader model, and bin_continuous = FALSE. We could tell the algorithm to bin continuous variables, but this may not make sense for categorical numeric data that we didn’t change to factors.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Run lime() on training set
explainer &lt;- lime::lime(
    as.data.frame(train_h2o[,-1]), 
    model = glm_model, 
    bin_continuous = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>Now we run the explain() function, which returns our explanation. This can take a minute to run so we limit it to just the first ten rows of the test data set.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>n_labels = 1</strong>: Explaining a single class.</li>
<li><strong>n_features = 4</strong>: Returns the top four features that are critical to each case.</li>
<li><strong>kernel_width = 0.5</strong>: Allows us to increase the “model_r2” value by shrinking the localized evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># Run explain() on explainer

<p>The payoff for the work we put in using LIME is this <strong>feature importance plot</strong>. This allows us to visualize each of the ten cases (observations) from the test data. The top four features for each case are shown. Note that they are not the same for each case.</p>
<ul>
<li>The blue bars mean that the feature <strong>supports</strong> the model conclusion.</li>
<li>The red bars <strong>contradict</strong>.</li>

<p>We’ll focus in on Cases with Label = Yes, which are predicted to have attrition. We can see a common theme with Case 1 and Case 7: Monthly income, Years at the company , No. of companies worked and Over Time are among the top factors influencing attrition.</p>
